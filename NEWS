Release Notes
=============

This document summarizes the most important changes in the current Bro
release. For a complete list of changes, see the ``CHANGES`` file.


Bro 2.1
-------

- Dependencies:

    * Bro now requires CMake >= 2.6.3.

- Bro now supports IPv6 out of the box; the configure switch
  --enable-brov6 is gone.

- DNS name lookups performed by Bro now also query AAAA records. The
  results of the A and AAAA queries for a given hostname are combined
  such that at the scripting layer, the name resolution can yield a
  set with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

- The connection compressor was already deprecated in 2.0 and has now
  been removed from the code base.

TODO: Extend.

Bro 2.0
-------

As the version number jump suggests, Bro 2.0 is a major upgrade and
lots of things have changed. We have assembled a separate upgrade
guide with the most important changes compared to Bro 1.5 at
http://www.bro-ids.org/documentation/upgrade.html. You can find
the offline version of that document in ``doc/upgrade.rst.``.

Compared to the earlier 2.0 Beta version, the major changes in the
final release are:

    * The default scripts now come with complete reference
      documentation. See
      http://www.bro-ids.org/documentation/index.html.

    * libz and libmagic are now required dependencies.

    * Reduced snaplen default from 65535 to old default of 8192. The
      large value was introducing performance problems on many
      systems.

    * Replaced the --snaplen/-l command line option with a
      scripting-layer option called "snaplen". The new option can also
      be redefined on the command line, e.g. ``bro -i eth0
      snaplen=65535``.

    * Reintroduced the BRO_LOG_SUFFIX environment variable that the
      ASCII logger now respects to add a suffix to the log files it
      creates.

    * The ASCII logs now include further header information, and 
      fields set to an empty value are now logged as ``(empty)`` by
      default (instead of ``-``, which is already used for fields that
      are not set at all).

    * Some NOTICES were renamed, and the signatures of some SSL events
      have changed.

    * bro-cut got some new capabilities:

        - If no field names are given on the command line, we now pass
          through all fields.

        - New options -u/-U for time output in UTC.

        - New option -F to give output field separator.

    * Broccoli supports more types internally, allowing to send
      complex records.

    * Many smaller bug fixes, portability improvements, and general
      polishing across all modules.
