Release Notes
=============

This document summarizes the most important changes in the current Bro
release. For a complete list of changes, see the ``CHANGES`` file.


Bro 2.1 Beta
------------

New Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Bro now comes with extensive IPv6 support. Past versions offered
  only basic IPv6 functionality that was rarely used in practice as it
  had to be enabled explicitly. IPv6 support is now fully integrated
  into all parts of Bro including protocol analysis and the scripting
  language. It's on by default and no longer requires any special
  configuration.

  Some of the most significant enhancements include support for IPv6
  fragment reassembly, support for following IPv6 extension header
  chains, and support for tunnel decapsulation (6to4 and Teredo). The
  DNS analyzer now handles AAAA records properly, and DNS lookups that
  Bro itself performs now include AAAA queries, so that, for example,
  the result returned by script-level lookups is a set that can
  contain both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Support for the most common
  ICMPv6 message types has been added. Also, the FTP EPSV and EPRT
  commands are now handled properly. Internally, the way IP addresses
  are stored has been improved, so Bro can handle both IPv4
  and IPv6 by default without any special configuration.

  In addition to Bro itself, the other Bro components have also been
  made IPv6-aware by default. In particular, significant changes were
  made to trace-summary, PySubnetTree, and Broccoli to support IPv6.

- Bro now decapsulates tunnels via its new tunnel framework located in
  scripts/base/frameworks/tunnels. It currently supports Teredo,
  AYIYA, IP-in-IP (both IPv4 and IPv6), and SOCKS. For all these, it
  logs the outher tunnel connections in both conn.log and tunnel.log,
  and then proceeds to analyze the inner payload as if it were not
  tunneled, including also logging that session in conn.log. For
  SOCKS, it generates a new socks.log in addition with more
  information.

- Bro now features a flexible input framework that allows users to
  integrate external information in real-time into Bro while it
  processing network traffic. The most direct use-case at the moment
  is reading data from ASCII files into Bro tables, with updates
  picked up automatically when the file changes during runtime. See
  doc/input.rst for more information.

  Internally, the input framework is structured around the notion of
  "reader plugins" that make it easy to interface to different data
  sources. We will add more in the future.

- Bro's default ASCII log format is not exactly the most efficient way
  for storing and searching large volumes of data. An an alternative,
  Bro nows comes with experimental support for DataSeries output, an
  efficient binary format for recording structured bulk data.
  DataSeries is developed and maintained at HP Labs. See
  doc/logging-dataseries for more information.


Changed Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following summarized the most important differences in existing
functionality. Note that this list is not complete, see CHANGES for
the full set.

- Changes in dependencies:

    * Bro now requires CMake >= 2.6.3.

    * Bro now links in tcmalloc (part of Google perftools) if found at
      configure time. Doing so can significantly improve memory and
      CPU use.

- The configure switch --enable-brov6 is gone.

- DNS name lookups performed by Bro now also query AAAA records. The
  results of the A and AAAA queries for a given hostname are combined
  such that at the scripting layer, the name resolution can yield a
  set with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

- The connection compressor was already deprecated in 2.0 and has now
  been removed from the code base.

- We removed the "match" statement, which was no longer used by any of
  the default scripts, nor was it likely to be used by anybody anytime
  soon. With that, "match" and "using" are no longer reserved keywords.

- The syntax for IPv6 literals changed from "2607:f8b0:4009:802::1012"
  to "[2607:f8b0:4009:802::1012]".

- Bro now spawns threads for doing its logging. From a user's
  perspective not much should change, except that the OS may now show
  a bunch of Bro threads.

- We renamed the configure option --enable-perftools to
  --enable-perftool-debug to indicate that the switch is only relevant
  for debugging the heap.

- Bro's ICMP analyzer now handles both IPv4 and IPv6 messages with a
  joint set of events.  The `icmp_conn` record got a new boolean field
  'v6' that indicates whether the ICMP message is v4 or v6.

- Log postprocessor scripts get an additional argument indicating the
  type of the log writer in use (e.g., "ascii").

- BroControl's make-archive-name scripts also receives the writer
  type, but as it's 2nd(!) argument. If you're using a custom version
  of that script, you need to adapt it. See the shipped version for
  details.

- Signature files can now be loaded via the new "@load-sigs"
  directive. In contrast to the existing (and still supported)
  signature_files constant, this can be used to load signatures
  relative to the current script (e.g., "@load-sigs ./foo.sig").

- The options "tunnel_port" and "parse_udp_tunnels" have been removed.
  Bro now supports decapsulating tunnels directly for protocols it
  understands.


Bro 2.0
-------

As the version number jump suggests, Bro 2.0 is a major upgrade and
lots of things have changed. We have assembled a separate upgrade
guide with the most important changes compared to Bro 1.5 at
http://www.bro-ids.org/documentation/upgrade.html. You can find
the offline version of that document in ``doc/upgrade.rst.``.

Compared to the earlier 2.0 Beta version, the major changes in the
final release are:

    * The default scripts now come with complete reference
      documentation. See
      http://www.bro-ids.org/documentation/index.html.

    * libz and libmagic are now required dependencies.

    * Reduced snaplen default from 65535 to old default of 8192. The
      large value was introducing performance problems on many
      systems.

    * Replaced the --snaplen/-l command line option with a
      scripting-layer option called "snaplen". The new option can also
      be redefined on the command line, e.g. ``bro -i eth0
      snaplen=65535``.

    * Reintroduced the BRO_LOG_SUFFIX environment variable that the
      ASCII logger now respects to add a suffix to the log files it
      creates.

    * The ASCII logs now include further header information, and
      fields set to an empty value are now logged as ``(empty)`` by
      default (instead of ``-``, which is already used for fields that
      are not set at all).

    * Some NOTICES were renamed, and the signatures of some SSL events
      have changed.

    * bro-cut got some new capabilities:

        - If no field names are given on the command line, we now pass
          through all fields.

        - New options -u/-U for time output in UTC.

        - New option -F to give output field separator.

    * Broccoli supports more types internally, allowing to send
      complex records.

    * Many smaller bug fixes, portability improvements, and general
      polishing across all modules.
